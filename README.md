Simple persistent keylogger developed in C++ with differents functionalities:

1. It adds registry keys in startup.
2. If deleted it's allocated in others folders (Appdata/Roaming, Temp) so basically it self-replicate himself.
3. It gets the foreground window.
4. It's hidden but visible with  the taskmgr
5. Other features not implemented will be changed in future.
